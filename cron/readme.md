## set-theme

* `gsettings` cli utility allow for cinnamon manupulation. See its manual for details.
* Theme names to set are taken directly from `Themes` application. It is possible to locate themes on disk and take names from there,\
  however I did not find them.
* [Kitty themes docs](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/)
* To schedule cron tasks use `crontab` utility. `crontab -e` to edit configuration, `crontab -l` to print current configuration.
